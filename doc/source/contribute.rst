Contributing tutorials
======================

.. attention::

  Make sure that you have `pycompwa` installed in :ref:`install/build:Developer
  Mode`, so that you can run the latest source code, including any
  modifications you implement yourself.

:mod:`pycompwa` is bound to continuously evolve as experimental and theoretical
insights progress. We therefore want the distinction between user and developer
to be as minimal as possible and aim to maintain an interactive and dynamic
platform for PWA software development.

The following pages guide you through some of the tools required to contribute
to this project. The pages are organised like a tutorial, but you can also use
them as reference material for contributing conventions.
